  abstract     = {We propose a general approach to compute the seed sensitivity, that can be applied to different definitions of seeds. It treats separately three components of the seed sensitivity problem - a set of target alignments, an associated probability distribution, and a seed model - that are specified by distinct finite automata. The approach is then applied to a new concept of subset seeds for which we propose an efficient automaton construction. Experimental results confirm that sensitive subset seeds can be efficiently designed using our approach, and can then be used in similarity search producing better results than ordinary spaced seeds.},

  abstract     = {Patterns with wildcards in specified positions, namely  , are increasingly used instead of  -mers in many bioinformatics applications that require indexing, querying and rapid similarity search, as they can provide better sensitivity. Many of these applications require to compute the hashing of each position in the input sequences with respect to the given spaced seed, or to multiple spaced seeds. While the hashing of  -mers can be rapidly computed by exploiting the large overlap between consecutive  -mers, spaced seeds hashing is usually computed from scratch for each position in the input sequence, thus resulting in slower processing. The method proposed in this paper, fast spaced-seed hashing (FSH), exploits the similarity of the hash values of spaced seeds computed at adjacent positions in the input sequence. In our experiments we compute the hash for each positions of metagenomics reads from several datasets, with respect to different spaced seeds. We also propose a generalized version of the algorithm for the simultaneous computation of multiple spaced seeds hashing. In the experiments, our algorithm can compute the hashing values of spaced seeds with a speedup, with respect to the traditional approach, between 1.6[Formula: see text] to 5.3[Formula: see text], depending on the structure of the spaced seed. Spaced seed hashing is a routine task for several bioinformatics application. FSH allows to perform this task efficiently and raise the question of whether other hashing can be exploited to further improve the speed up. This has the potential of major impact in the field, making spaced seed applications not only accurate, but also faster and more efficient.

The best sensitivity/selectivity trade-offs are obtained using many seeds simultaneously: This is known as the multiple seed approach. Unfortunately, spaced seeds use a large amount of memory and the available RAM is a practical limit to the number of seeds one can use simultaneously. Inspired by some recent results on lossless seeds, we revisit the approach of using a single spaced seed and considering two regions homologous if the seed hits in at least t sufficiently close positions. We show that by choosing the locations of the don't care symbols in the seed using quadratic residues modulo a prime number, we derive single seeds that when used with a threshold t > 1 have competitive sensitivity/selectivity trade-offs, indeed close to the best multiple seeds known in the literature. In addition, the choice of the threshold t can be adjusted to modify sensitivity and selectivity a posteriori, thus enabling a more accurate search in the specific instance at issue. The seeds we propose also exhibit robustness and allow flexibility in usage. },

  abstract        = {Introduction of spaced speeds opened a way of sensitivity improvement in homology search without loss of search speed. Since then, the efforts of finding optimal seed which maximizes the sensitivity have been continued today. The sensitivity of a seed is generally computed by its hit probability. However, the limitation of hit probability is that it computes the sensitivity only at a specific similarity level while homologous regions usually distributed in various similarity levels. As a result, the optimal seed found by hit probability is not actually optimal for various similarity levels. Therefore, a new measure of seed sensitivity is required to recommend seeds that are robust to various similarity levels. We propose a new probability model of sensitivity hit integration which covers a range of similarity levels of homologous regions. A novel algorithm of computing hit integration is proposed which is based on integration of hit probabilities at a range of similarity levels. We also prove that hit integration is computable by expressing the integral part of hit integration as a recursive formula which can be easily solved by dynamic programming. The experimental results for biological data show that hit integration reveals the seeds more optimal than those by PatternHunter. The presented model is a more general model to estimate sensitivity than hit probability by relaxing similarity level. We propose a novel algorithm which directly computes the sensitivity at a range of similarity levels.},

Recently, Ma et al. discovered that better filtering can be achieved by spacing out the matching positions according to a certain pattern, instead of contiguous positions to trigger a local alignment in their PatternHunter program. Such a match pattern is called a spaced seed. Our numerical computation shows that the ranks of spaced seeds (based on sensitivity) change with the sequences similarity. Since homologous sequences may have diverse similarity, we assess the sensitivity of spaced seeds over a range of similarity levels and present a list of good spaced seeds for facilitating homology search in DNA genomic sequences. We validate that the listed spaced seeds are indeed more sensitive using three arbitrarily chosen pairs of DNA genomic sequences.},

Despite decades of research, this is not a solved problem because there exist many similarities that are not found by current methods. Search methods are typically based on a seed-and-extend approach, which has many variants (e.g. spaced seeds, transition seeds), and it remains unclear how to optimize this approach. This study designs and tests seeding methods for inter-mammal and inter-insect genome comparison. By considering substitution patterns of real genomes, we design sets of multiple complementary transition seeds, which have better performance (sensitivity per run time) than previous seeding strategies. Often the best seed patterns have more transition positions than those used previously. We also point out that recent computer memory sizes (e.g. 60 GB) make it feasible to use multiple (e.g. eight) seeds for whole mammal genomes. Interestingly, the most sensitive settings achieve diminishing returns for human-dog and melanogaster-pseudoobscura comparisons, but not for human-mouse, which suggests that we still miss many human-mouse alignments. Our optimized heuristics find ∼20,000 new human-mouse alignments that are missing from the standard UCSC alignments. We tabulate seed patterns and parameters that work well so they can be used in future research.},

  abstract        = {Optimizing seed selection is an important problem in read mapping. The number of non-overlapping seeds a mapper selects determines the sensitivity of the mapper while the total frequency of all selected seeds determines the speed of the mapper. Modern seed-and-extend mappers usually select seeds with either an equal and fixed-length scheme or with an inflexible placement scheme, both of which limit the ability of the mapper in selecting less frequent seeds to speed up the mapping process. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a new algorithm that can adjust both the individual seed length and the seed placement, as well as derive less frequent seeds. We present the Optimal Seed Solver (OSS), a dynamic programming algorithm that discovers the least frequently-occurring set of x seeds in an L-base-pair read in [Formula: see text] operations on average and in [Formula: see text] operations in the worst case, while generating a maximum of [Formula: see text] seed frequency database lookups. We compare OSS against four state-of-the-art seed selection schemes and observe that OSS provides a 3-fold reduction in average seed frequency over the best previous seed selection optimizations. We provide an implementation of the Optimal Seed Solver in C++ at: https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/Optimal-Seed-Solver hxin@cmu.edu, calkan@cs.bilkent.edu.tr or onur@cmu.edu Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here we show that average correlation c(z) is a good predicator of hitting probability q (n), and the generalized correlation function ĉ(z) can be used to approximate c(z) efficiently. We apply the method to the problem of optimal multiple spaced seed selection for homology search. We reexamine the concept of optimal sensitivity of spaced seeds and show that it is better to select optimal seeds based on some average properties, such as c(1), which is the expectation of the first hitting length. Higher order approximations can also be constructed easily. Tests on arbitrary large genomic data with multiple seeds show that the optimal multiple seeds selected by the methods are indeed more sensitive. The methods provide a theoretical background on which various empirical observations can be unified and further heuristic search methods can be developed.},

With the further improvement provided by multiple spaced seeds in PatternHunterII, Smith-Waterman sensitivity is approached at BLASTn speed. However, computing optimal multiple spaced seeds was proved to be NP-hard and current heuristic algorithms are all very slow (exponential). We give a simple algorithm which computes good multiple seeds in polynomial time. Due to a completely different approach, the difference with respect to the previous methods is dramatic. The multiple spaced seed of PatternHunterII, with 16 weight 11 seeds, was computed in 12 days. It takes us 17 s to find a better one.

However, elucidating the mechanism that confers power to spaced seeds and characterizing optimal spaced seeds still remain unsolved. This paper investigates these two important open questions by formally analyzing the average number of non-overlapping hits and the hit probability of a spaced seed in the Bernoulli sequence model. We prove that when the length of a non-uniformly spaced seed is bounded above by an exponential function of the seed weight, the seed outperforms strictly the traditional consecutive seed of the same weight in both 1) the average number of non-overlapping hits and 2) the asymptotic hit probability. This clearly answers the first problem mentioned above in the Bernoulli sequence model. The theoretical study in this paper also gives a new solution to finding long optimal seeds.},

We study the problem of computing optimal spaced seeds for detecting homologous coding regions in unannotated genomic sequences. By using well-chosen seeds, we are able to improve the sensitivity of coding sequence alignment over that of TBLASTX, while keeping runtime comparable to BLASTN. We identify good seeds by first giving effective hidden Markov models of conservation in alignments of homologous coding regions. We give an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal spaced seed when conservation patterns are generated by these models. Our results offer the hope of improved gene finding due to fewer missed exons in DNA/DNA comparison, and more effective homology search in general, and may have applications outside of bioinformatics.},

Recent innovations in seed structure include spaced seeds and indel seeds which are more sensitive than contiguous seeds. Evaluating seed sensitivity requires (i) specifying a homology model for alignments and (ii) assigning probabilities to those alignments. Optimal seed selection is resource intensive because all alternative seeds must be tested. Current methods require that the model and its probability parameters be specified in advance. When the parameters change, the entire calculation has to be rerun. We show how to eliminate the need for prior parameter specification by exploiting a simple observation: given a homology model, the alignments hit by a particular seed remain the same regardless of the probability parameters. Only the weights assigned to those alignments change. Therefore, if we know all the hits, we can easily (and quickly) find optimal seeds. We describe an efficient preprocessing step, which is computed once per seed. Then we show several increasingly efficient methods to find the optimal seed when given specific probability parameters. Indeed, we show how to determine exactly which seeds can never be optimal under any set of probability parameters. This leads to the startling observation that out of thousands of seeds, only a handful have any chance of being optimal. We then show how to identify optimal seeds and the boundaries within probability space where they are optimal.},

So far, seed performance has been tested for comparisons between closely related species, such as human and mouse, or on simulated data. As the number and variety of genomes increases, it becomes desirable to identify a small set of universal seeds that perform optimally or near-optimally on a large range of comparisons. Using statistical regression methods, we investigate the sensitivity of seeds, in particular good seeds, between four cDNA-to-genome comparisons at different evolutionary distances (human-dog, human-mouse, human-chicken and human-zebrafish), and identify classes of comparisons that show similar seed behavior and therefore can employ the same seed. In addition, we find that with high confidence good seeds for more distant comparisons perform well on closer comparisons, within 98-99% of the optimal seeds, and thus represent universal good seeds. We show for the first time that optimal and near-optimal seeds for distant species-to-species comparisons are more generally applicable to a wide range of comparisons. This finding will be instrumental in developing practical and user-friendly cDNA-to-genome alignment applications, to aid in the annotation of new model organisms.},

In this paper, we propose a probability leakage model (a dissipative Markov system) to elucidate the mechanism that confers power to spaced seeds. Based on this model, we identify desirable features of gapped search seeds and formulate an extremely efficient procedure for seed design: it samples from the set of spaced seed exhibiting those features, evaluates their sensitivity, and then selects the best. The sensitivity of the constructed seeds is negligibly less than that of the corresponding known optimal seeds. While the challenging mathematical question of characterizing optimal search seeds remains open, we believe that our eminently efficient and effective approach represents a satisfactory solution from a practitioner's viewpoint.},

Initially proposed to detect sequence similarities and to anchor sequence alignments, spaced seeds have more recently been applied in several   related methods. Unfortunately, spaced seeds need to be initially designed. This task is known to be time-consuming due to the number of spaced seed candidates. Moreover, it can be altered by a set of   parameters from the probabilistic alignment models used. In this general context,   have been introduced by Mak and Benson (Bioinformatics 25:302-308, 2009) on the Bernoulli model, in order to reduce the number of spaced seed candidates that are further processed in a   calculation of the sensitivity. We expand the scope of work of Mak and Benson on single and multiple seeds by considering the Hit Integration model of Chung and Park (BMC Bioinform 11:31, 2010), demonstrate that the same dominance definition can be applied, and that a parameter-free study can be performed without any significant additional cost. We also consider two new discrete models, namely the Heaviside and the Dirac models, where lossless seeds can be integrated. From a theoretical standpoint, we establish a generic framework on all the proposed models, by applying a   to quickly compute large polynomial coefficients needed by the   filter. From a practical standpoint, we confirm that   reduce the set of, either single seeds to thoroughly analyse, or multiple seeds to store. Moreover, in http://bioinfo.cristal.univ-lille.fr/yass/iedera_dominance, we provide a full list of spaced seeds computed on the four aforementioned models, with one (continuous) parameter left free for each model, and with several (discrete) alignment lengths.},

Since the exact dynamic programming algorithm is quadratic, linear-time heuristics such as BLAST are used. Spaced seeds are much more sensitive than the consecutive seed of BLAST and using several seeds represents the current state of the art in approximate search for biological sequences. The most important aspect is computing highly sensitive seeds. Since the problem seems hard, heuristic algorithms are used. The leading software in the common Bernoulli model is the SpEED program. SpEED uses a hill climbing method based on the overlap complexity heuristic. We propose a new algorithm for this heuristic that improves its speed by over one order of magnitude. We use the new implementation to compute improved seeds for several software programs. We compute as well multiple seeds of the same weight as MegaBLAST, that greatly improve its sensitivity. Multiple spaced seeds are being successfully used in bioinformatics software programs. Enabling researchers to compute very fast high quality seeds will help expanding the range of their applications.},

Standard search techniques start by detecting small matching parts, called seeds, between a query sequence and database sequences. Contiguous seed models have existed for many years. Recently, spaced seeds were shown to be more sensitive than contiguous seeds without increasing the random hit rate. To determine the superiority of one seed model over another, a model of homologous sequence alignment must be chosen. Previous studies evaluating spaced and contiguous seeds have assumed that matches and mismatches occur within these alignments, but not insertions and deletions (indels). This is perhaps appropriate when searching for protein coding sequences (<5% of the human genome), but is inappropriate when looking for repeats in the majority of genomic sequence where indels are common. In this paper, we assume a model of homologous sequence alignment which includes indels and we describe a new seed model, called indel seeds, which explicitly allows indels. We present a waiting time formula for computing the sensitivity of an indel seed and show that indel seeds significantly outperform contiguous and spaced seeds when homologies include indels. We discuss the practical aspect of using indel seeds and finally we present results from a search for inverted repeats in the dog genome using both indel and spaced seeds.},

However, searching a short pattern in a text with high error rates (10–20%) under the Levenshtein distance is a task for which few efficient solutions exist. Here we address this problem by introducing a new type of seeds: the 01⁎0 seeds. These seeds are made of two exact parts separated by parts with exactly one error. We show that those seeds are lossless, and we apply them to two filtration algorithms for two popular applications, one where a compressed index is built on the text and another one where the patterns are indexed. We also demonstrate experimentally the advantages of our approach compared to alternative methods implementing other types of seeds. This work opens the way to the design of more efficient and more sensitive text algorithms.},
