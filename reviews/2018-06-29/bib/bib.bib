  abstract = {The alignment of sequencing reads against a protein reference database is a major computational bottleneck in metagenomics and data-intensive evolutionary projects. Although recent tools offer improved performance over the gold standard BLASTX, they exhibit only a modest speedup or low sensitivity. We introduce DIAMOND, an open-source algorithm based on double indexing that is 20,000 times faster than BLASTX on short reads and has a similar degree of sensitivity.},

  abstract = {A method of finding pattern similarities between two sequences is given. Two portions, one from each sequence, are similar if they are close in the metric space of evolutionary distances. The method allows a complete list to be made of all pairs of intervals, one from each of two given sequences, such that each pair displays a maximum local degree of similarity, and, if the lengths of the given sequences are m and n, then the procedure takes on the order of mn computational steps. This result lends itself to finding similarities by computer between pairs of biological sequences, such as proteins and nucleic acids.},

  abstract        = {In homology search, good spaced seeds have higher sensitivity for the same cost (weight). However, elucidating the mechanism that confers power to spaced seeds and characterizing optimal spaced seeds still remain unsolved. This paper investigates these two important open questions by formally analyzing the average number of non-overlapping hits and the hit probability of a spaced seed in the Bernoulli sequence model. We prove that when the length of a non-uniformly spaced seed is bounded above by an exponential function of the seed weight, the seed outperforms strictly the traditional consecutive seed of the same weight in both 1) the average number of non-overlapping hits and 2) the asymptotic hit probability. This clearly answers the first problem mentioned above in the Bernoulli sequence model. The theoretical study in this paper also gives a new solution to finding long optimal seeds.},
