= Spaced Seeds

Spaced seeds are short patterns of match and don't-care positions.

A spaced seed is said to match if all match-positions match.

They were introduced in PatternHunter.

== Single Seeds

* It has been shown in 'Superiority and complexity of the spaced seeds', that spaced seeds lead to more statisically independent hits.

== Multiple seeds

* In practice, one wants to not only use a single seed but multiple different seeds. This increases sensivity while also decreasing performance.
