= Sequence search in databases

I am interested in quickly finding approximate matches of prodivded sequences in large data sets.

== Definition

Searching a single sequence in a given data set results in an set of alignments of the given sequence against homologous regions
in the data set.

== General outline

The enable _approximate string matching_ in large data sets we try to solve the problem using _exact matching_ problem.

To speed up the search, it is split into several steps. 

=== Indexing

The _indexing_ step sets up an index structure which allows fast access to information used that is used later on.
The index structure that is used varies from algorithm to algothm (e.g. HashMap, [[FM-Index]] or [[Suffix array]]).

=== Searching for Seeds

Searching the entire database using alignment algorithms is prohibited from a performance perspective (O(n^2)).

[ ] TODO: What does it mean for a query to match against the data set?

In stead we search for smaller parts of the query that match the data set. These smaller parts are often called _seeds_. 

Blast:
[[Contiguous Seeds]]

PatternHunter:
[[Spaced Seeds]]

=== Validation

After a hit candidate has been identified, the hit is verified and aligned if succesful.
